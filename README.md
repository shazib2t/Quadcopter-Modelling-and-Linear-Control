Modelling and Linear Control of Quadcopter in One Dimension and Control System Analysis

Abstractâ€”This report paper focuses and explains in detail step by step process and implementation of how Quadcopter mathematical model can be used to represent the control of a system. Mathematical model has been developed and performed numerous control system analysis tool to understand the system response and develop a stable system.Matlab Software has been used to validate the model based on theoretical approach and proposed in this paper.
